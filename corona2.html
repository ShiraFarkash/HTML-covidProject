        Ministry of Health transparency:
        Minister of Health Yuli (Yoel) Edelstein launched this evening (Thursday, 18.6.20) the Ministry of Health's new database, displaying all Coronavirus-related figures.
        The goal is to communicate to the public the full information at the Ministry of Health's disposal, in the simplest and clearest terms.
        The daily situation assessment, which was only published statically so far, will now be visualized by a link to a visual and tangible tool.
        It should be noted that changes and updates to the data may occur.
        Minister Edelstein: "Containing the Coronavirus is everyone's struggle, and the data is everyone's. The new website will significantly increase the transparency of the Ministry of Health's activities vis-à-vis the public, as I believe that it should be. This is sevenfold truer when all the citizens of Israel are bound by destiny. I wish to thank the Ministry's professional teams who have done much to make this website as accessible as possible".
